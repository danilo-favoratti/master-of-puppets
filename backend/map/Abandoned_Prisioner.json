  "complete_narrative": "You find yourself in 'A desolate island, scarred by a forgotten past, where silence reigns and echoes of despair linger.'. The air holds a sense of Somber and Mystical. Theme: 'Abandoned Prisoner'...\n\n**World:**\nOcean, small islands (~24% land)\n\n**Quest: The Light of Freedom**\nAwaken on a deserted island with no memory of arrival. Unravel the mystery of your imprisonment and escape the island's grasp.\n- Discover the source of a mysterious light in the center of the island.\n- Find and assemble pieces of a forgotten map.\n- Unlock the secrets hidden in an ancient chest.\n\n**Notable Features:**\n- Chest: An old wooden chest, worn by time, with its lock long rusted and broken. It sits half-buried in the dirt, perhaps holding forgotten treasures of past inmates.\n- Tree: A Chestnut Tree.\n- Log: A Medium Fallen Log.\n- Plant: A Grass.\n- Campfire [unlit]: A Unlit Campfire (unlit).\n- ...and 11 more descriptions.\n\n**Possible Interactions:**\n- Open with chest: As you pry open the chest, a creak of age fills the air. Dust rises, revealing the glint of metal and a fragment of an old map.\n- Ignite with campfire: The flames struggled against the wind but soon roared to life, casting flickering shadows that danced among the trees.\n- Search with backpack: Rummaging through the backpack, your fingers found rough fabric and hard metal. There's more here than dust and decay."
