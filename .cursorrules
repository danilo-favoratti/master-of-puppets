# Cursor Rules Configuration for the Fullstack Project
#
# This file provides rules for the Cursor tool to identify and prioritize relevant
# source files in the fullstack project. It includes essential file extensions,
# directories, and excludes non-essential code, documentation, and build artifacts.
#
# [General]
# Union of common frontend and backend file extensions.
extensions = html, js, jsx, ts, tsx, css, scss, sass, less, json, py, go, java, rb, php
#
# [Directories]
# Combined directories for both backend and frontend code.
include_dirs = src, app, controllers, routes, models, services, config, public, components, assets, styles
#
# [Exclusions]
# Directories and files to be ignored.
exclude_dirs = node_modules, vendor, tests, coverage, logs, dist, build, .git
exclude_files = *.spec.js, *.test.js, *.min.js, *.d.ts, *.bundle.js, *.lock, .env
#
# [Priority]
# Files that are considered as primary entry points for the project.
priority_files = server.js, app.js, index.js, main.ts, app.py, index.html, App.js, main.tsx
#
# [General Rules]
# 1. Always use the latest version of the language, framework, library, tool, database, and operating system.
# 2. Check for conflicts when adding new languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, databases, and operating systems.
# 3. Always write code that is clean, readable, secure, and maintainable.
# 4. Think about the user experience when writing code.
# 5. Plan first, ask follow-up questions, and then write code.
